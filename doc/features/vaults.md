# Vaults

Vaults are isolated containers that hold contacts and their associated data. They provide data separation and access control for multi-user setups.

## Why Vaults?

- **Data isolation** — Contacts in different vaults are separate, with the exception of [cross-vault relationships](/features/contacts#cross-vault-relationships)
- **Shared access** — Invite other users to collaborate on the same vault
- **Role-based permissions** — Control who can do what

## Roles

Each user in a vault has one of three roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Manager** | Full access: create, edit, delete contacts and vault settings. Can invite others. |
| **Editor** | Can create and edit contacts, but cannot manage vault settings or users. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to contacts. Cannot modify anything. |

## Creating a Vault

After logging in, create your first vault from the dashboard. Give it a name and optional description. The creator automatically becomes the **Manager**.

## Vault-level Settings

Each vault has its own set of defaults, seeded on creation:

- **Important date types** — Birthdate, deceased date (built-in), plus custom types
- **Mood tracking parameters** — 5-level mood scale with emoji and colors
- **Life event categories** — 4 categories with 20 event types
- **Quick facts templates** — Hobbies, food preferences

## Inviting Users

Vault managers can invite other users to join the vault through the [User Invitations](/features/more#user-invitations) system. Each invitation specifies a permission level.

## Switching Vaults

If you have access to multiple vaults, use the vault switcher in the navigation bar to move between them. Each vault maintains its own contact list, settings, and search index.
