A modern, community-driven personal relationship manager — inspired by [Monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica), rebuilt with **Go** and **React**.

## Why Bonds?

Monica is a beloved open-source personal CRM with 24k+ stars. But as a side project maintained by a tiny team ([their own words](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/issues/6626)), development has slowed — 700+ open issues and limited bandwidth.

**Bonds** picks up where Monica left off:

- **Fast & lightweight** — Single binary, starts in milliseconds, minimal memory
- **Easy to deploy** — One binary + SQLite. No PHP, no Composer, no Node runtime
- **Modern UI** — React 19 + TypeScript, smooth SPA experience
- **Well tested** — 1014 backend tests, 129 frontend tests, 174 E2E tests
- **Community first** — Built for contributions and fast iteration

> **Credits**: Bonds stands on the shoulders of [@djaiss](https://github.com/djaiss), [@asbiin](https://github.com/asbiin), and the entire Monica community. The original Monica remains available under AGPL-3.0 at [monicahq/monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica).

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Download docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naiba/bonds/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start the service
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and create your account.

To customize settings, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here   # ⚠️ Change this!
```

### Option 2: Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/naiba/bonds/releases), then:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
./bonds-server
```

The server starts at **http://localhost:8080** with an embedded frontend and SQLite database.

### Option 3: Build from Source

**Prerequisites**: Go 1.25+, [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.x

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naiba/bonds.git
cd bonds

# Install dependencies
make setup

# Build a single binary (frontend embedded)
make build-all

# Run it
export JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
./server/bin/bonds-server
```

## Configuration

Bonds uses a **hybrid configuration** approach:

- **Environment variables** — For essential infrastructure settings (database, server, security)
- **Admin UI** — For all runtime settings (SMTP, OAuth, Telegram, WebAuthn, etc.)

On first startup, environment variables are seeded into the database. After that, manage settings from **Admin > System Settings** in the web UI.

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

### Environment Variables (Required)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug mode: Echo request logging, GORM SQL logging, Swagger UI (default on) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | — | **Required in production.** Signing key for auth tokens |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `8080` | Port the server listens on |
| `SERVER_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Host address the server binds to |
| `DB_DSN` | `bonds.db` | Database connection string. SQLite: file path; PostgreSQL: `host=... port=5432 user=... password=... dbname=... sslmode=disable` |
| `DB_DRIVER` | `sqlite` | Database driver (`sqlite` or `postgres`) |
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | Set to `production` for production use |
| `STORAGE_UPLOAD_DIR` | `uploads` | File upload directory |
| `BLEVE_INDEX_PATH` | `data/bonds.bleve` | Full-text search index directory |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `data/backups` | Directory to store backup files |

### Admin UI Settings

The following are managed from the **Admin > System Settings** page after login:

- **Application** — Name, URL, Announcement banner
- **Authentication** — Password auth toggle, User registration toggle
- **JWT** — Token expiry, Refresh window
- **SMTP** — Host, Port, Username, Password, Sender email
- **OAuth / OIDC** — GitHub, Google, and OIDC/SSO credentials
- **WebAuthn** — Relying Party ID, Display Name, Origins
- **Telegram** — Bot token for notifications
- **Geocoding** — Provider (Nominatim/LocationIQ), API key
- **Storage** — Max upload size
- **Backup** — Cron schedule, Retention days
 **Swagger** — Enable/disable API documentation UI

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
make setup

# Generate API client (required before first build)
make gen-api

# Start both frontend and backend in dev mode
make dev
```

This runs the Go backend on `:8080` and the Vite dev server on `:5173`. The frontend automatically proxies API requests to the backend.

### Code Generation Pipeline

The frontend TypeScript API client is **auto-generated** from the backend's OpenAPI/Swagger spec. The generated files are not committed to git — they are regenerated in CI and during development.

```
Go handlers (swag annotations)
    ↓  make swagger
server/docs/swagger.json
    ↓  make gen-api (or bun run gen:api)
web/src/api/generated/   ← gitignored, regenerated on demand
    ↓
web/src/api/index.ts     ← entry point, imports generated modules
```

After changing any backend API (handlers, DTOs, routes), run:

```bash
make gen-api       # Regenerate swagger.json + TypeScript API client
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
make dev           # Start frontend + backend in dev mode
make build         # Build backend + frontend separately
make build-all     # Build single binary with embedded frontend
make test          # Run all tests (backend + frontend)
make test-e2e      # Run end-to-end tests (Playwright)
make lint          # Run linters (go vet + eslint)
make swagger       # Regenerate Swagger/OpenAPI docs only
make gen-api       # Regenerate Swagger docs + TypeScript API client
make clean         # Clean all build artifacts + generated files
make setup         # Install all dependencies
```

### API Documentation

Bonds provides auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation covering all 345 API endpoints.

To access the Swagger UI, either enable debug mode or toggle it on in Admin > Settings > Swagger:
```bash
# Option 1: Debug mode (Swagger enabled by default)
DEBUG=true ./bonds-server
# Option 2: Enable via Admin UI without debug mode
# Go to Admin > Settings > Swagger > Enable
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

> Swagger UI defaults to the `DEBUG` flag, but can be independently toggled from the Admin Settings page.

## Relationship to Monica

Bonds is a ground-up rewrite inspired by [Monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica) (AGPL-3.0). It re-implements Monica's data model and feature set using a completely different tech stack (Go + React instead of PHP/Laravel + Vue). It contains no code from the original project.
